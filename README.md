# Starbucks Capstone Project

## Project Description
This project contains mimiced user behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile application. In this app, Starbucks sends out offers to its customers, like BOGO (buy one, get one free) or a discount. Different users get different offers. So the main goal of this project was to figure out which offers succeed the most to which types of customers.

## About the Data
